###  Pseudo code 

#### 
1. Initialize Game

   - Create a deck of dominoes ( Double Six set)
   - Shuffle the deck
   - Initialize empty player hand and board
   - Deal initial dominoes to the player 
2. Game Loop

   WHILE the game is not over:
       - Display player hand and board
       - Display game options (Draw Domino, End Turn)
       - Get player action

3. Handle Player Action

       - Draw a domino from the deck
       - Add the domino to the player's hand

    IF player chooses to place a domino on the board:
       - Verify that the move is valid
           - Check if the domino matches the open ends on the board
       - Place the domino on the board
       - Remove the domino from the player's hand

4. Check Game State

    IF the deck is empty and the player cannot draw:
       - End the game

    IF the player has no more dominoes:
       - End the game

     ELSE IF no valid moves are possible for the player:
       - End the player's turn
       - Allow the next player to take their turn
